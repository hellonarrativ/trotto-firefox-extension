About
=====

üêΩ trot.to is an organization-specific URL shortening service

This is a Firefox extension that expands the "go" links, like `go/example` into the appropriate full URL.

This extension is a blind copy of the official Chrome extension[0,1], with configuration fixed so that it works with Firefox.
